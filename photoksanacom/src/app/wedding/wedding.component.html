            The first thing you should do is to remember that your wedding is a special event for your couple, 
            it is a very important day for both of you, your friends and family members. 
            It is not only a day for taking pictures in beautiful clothes â€“ you can do it any other day, 
            dressing up and taking a photographer for a walk. Be happy, smile, laugh, cry, feel free 
            to express any kind emotions and feelings this day, YOUR DAY! As a wedding photographer 
            I will notice them and capture all these moments so that you could keep them all your life. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Feel free to express your feelings and emotions to each other. When walking, try not to 
            look at your feet, otherwise the faces in the pictures will be almost invisible. 
            Look at each other or on the sides. Be as natural as possible, this will reflect your 
            personality in the pictures. Do not hesitate to express all your ideas to the photographer, 
            this is your holiday, and any idea can be implemented if you wish.
