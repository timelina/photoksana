          I am always more than happy to share your family special event, by capturing every moment
          of it. Our sessions highlight unique personality of each family member, genuinee motions
          and relationship between family members. To convey the atmosphere of every family,
          I need to join them emotionally, understand the mood and the role of each family member,
          understand their feelings and their history. We work closely with each our client to
          achieve a look that reflects their personality, feelings and style. Our clients come to us
          to book their photo session over and over again. They prefer us because they know they are
          in right hands. They trust us. We discuss every detail prior to our session: style, color,
          location, time, clothes, make-up, hair, other details to get a great result.

          I guarantee the most comfortable shooting atmosphere during the entire session. I understand
          the importance of every shot and treat the role of your photos as your family heritage.

          Preparation for the family photo shooting is very important. The shots are expected to be
          full of love and harmony of your family. They must give energy and positive emotions.
          That is why it is very important to plan family photo session in details.
          Below you will find my simple advise when you plan your photoshooting.

            <i class="fa fa-map-pin"></i><b> Choose location.</b>
            If you are going to photograph your family at home, make sure
            there are no many furniture items in the room and there is enough space to place all
            family members. About locations you may also read in this
            <a routerLink="/blog" class="text-blue">article</a>.
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            <i class="fa fa-star"></i><b> Choose outfit.</b>
            I have several recommendations to the outfits in this
            <a routerLink="/blog" class="text-blue">article</a>.
            In the family photography it is very important that all family membersâ€™ outfits go well together.
            Group colors and hues. Prepare all you are going to put on: clean and iron if possible.
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            <i class="fa fa-clock-o"></i><b> Choose time.</b> Choose the ideal time for your family. It depends on your
            family rhythm.
            Choose time when your kid is active and cheerful.
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            <i class="fa fa-coffee"></i> <b>If you are with a kid, </b>
            bring toys, water and snacks (not candy and chocolate) for your kid.
            During cold season bring a blanket with you to warm your child between shots.
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            <i class="fa fa-eye"></i><b> Pay attention</b>
            to your hair, nails and makeup
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            <i class="fa fa-handshake-o"></i><b> Trust your photographer</b>
            and try to not pay attention to camera.
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>
            And finally, <b>bring your peace and high spirit.</b> Remember: your smiles on the photographs
            must be natural. Feel free to give hugs and kisses to your child.
            Great captures happen when all family members are busy with something: playing and having fun.
